# MuckRock Foundation's open source code and data

Founded in 2010, the non-profit MuckRock Foundation helps the public access, understand and use information in support of a stronger democracy. Code for our major services is hosted on GitHub, including [MuckRock/FOIA Machine](https://github.com/MuckRock/muckrock); DocumentCloud's [backend](https://github.com/MuckRock/documentcloud) and [frontend](https://github.com/MuckRock/documentcloud-frontend); [our account management service Squarelet](https://github.com/MuckRock/squarelet); and a collection of Add-Ons that [extend DocumentCloud's functionality](https://www.documentcloud.org/help/add-ons/). Our open source transcription software, oTranscribe, lives in [a separate GitHub account](https://github.com/otranscribe).

We also use GitHub to host data and methodology for [our original reporting](http://muckrock.com/news/). Our [guide to editorial GitHub repositories](https://github.com/MuckRock/news-team) includes links to our stories and the data behind them.
